The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems.

Components
Subject: The object that holds the state and notifies observers of any changes.
Observer: The interface or abstract class that defines the update method, which is called when the subject's state changes.
ConcreteObserver: A class that implements the Observer interface and defines the behavior that should occur when notified.
